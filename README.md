## Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically apply syntax highlighting to files in any Azure DevOps pull request you view. There are no additional steps required.

## Configuration

![Options Page](assets/screenshots/options-page.png)

The extension's options page allows you to customize its behavior. You can access it through your browser's extension management page, usually by right-clicking the extension icon and selecting "Options".

### Custom Host Permissions

If you use a self-hosted or custom domain for Azure DevOps (e.g., `devops.mycompany.com`), you'll need to grant the extension permission to access it.

1.  Open the extension options.
2.  In the "Manage Custom Hosts" section, enter the hostname (e.g., `devops.mycompany.com`).
3.  Click "Add Host". Your browser will ask you to confirm the permission.

### Custom File Type Mappings

You can override the default language detection by mapping specific file patterns to a language. This is useful for files with non-standard extensions or for file types that aren't automatically recognized.

1.  Open the extension options.
2.  Go to the "Custom File Type Mappings" section.
3.  Enter a file pattern (e.g., `*.myext`, `Jenkinsfile`, `*.config.json`).
4.  Select the desired language from the dropdown.
5.  Click "Add Pattern".

Custom patterns take priority over the default language detection.
